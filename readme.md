Welcome to the NYC LinkNYC Kiosks Interactive Map project! This project aims to provide a visual representation of LinkNYC kiosks across all boroughs of New York City using cartographical data. Users can explore and locate LinkNYC kiosks conveniently on the map and click on the location to see details about the particular Kisosk. 

## Features

- **Kiosk Details:** Click on individual kiosks to view detailed information, such as location, status, and additional relevant data.


## Data Sources
